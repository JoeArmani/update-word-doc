# update-word-doc
simple .net form app to open, copy, rename, then find &amp; replace text on MSWord doc.

Possibly the greatest form app ever. Kidding, but this saves a ton of time customizing MSWord docs that need to be a little different every time. Cover letters and client proposals might be a two great examples.
